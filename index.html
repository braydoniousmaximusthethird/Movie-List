        <hr />
        <h3>Maze Runner The Death Cure</h3>
        Good ending to the trilogy, and way better than the god awful books. 
        <h3>Deadpool vs Wolverine</h3>
        Funny movie and was amazing in IMAX.
        <h3>Quiet Place Day One</h3>
        One of the only movies that had me on edge the entire time.
